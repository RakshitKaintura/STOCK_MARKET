## The Why

Investors and traders need a lightweight, fast interface to monitor prices, collect news, and keep personal watchlists without the overhead of heavy trading platforms. Stock Markett provides:

- A single-pane dashboard for quick stock lookups and visualizations
- Persistent user watchlists and signup flows
- Automated background tasks for digest emails and lightweight analytics

This project is ideal as a portfolio piece because it demonstrates full-stack capabilities: authentication, persistent storage, third-party data integration, background processing, and a modern React UI.

## Key Features

- **Next.js App Router + TypeScript** — modern SSR/SSG and clean type-safety across the stack.
- **Persistent Watchlist (MongoDB + Mongoose)** — users can save & manage watchlists stored in MongoDB.
- **Auth with Better Auth** — email/password auth with `better-auth` and cookie-based session handling.
- **Trading UIs** — embedded TradingView widgets and TickerTape components for interactive charts.
- **AI Stock Analysis (LangGraph + Gemini)** — agentic analysis pipeline using `@langchain/langgraph` and `@langchain/google-genai` to orchestrate data-fetch → LLM analysis nodes.
- **Background Jobs (Inngest)** — async workflows for welcome emails and daily news summaries.
- **Email Notifications (Nodemailer)** — transactional emails for signup & digests.

## AI Stock Analysis (LangGraph Agentic Workflow)

This project implements an agentic, state-graph workflow for per-symbol AI-driven analysis located at [app/api/stock-analysis/route.ts](app/api/stock-analysis/route.ts). Key points:

- Orchestration: `StateGraph` composes nodes (`fetch_stock` → `analyze`) to create an explainable, stepwise analysis flow.
- LLM: `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` (Gemini) is invoked when `GEMINI_API_KEY` is available; otherwise the route falls back to a deterministic analysis generator.
- Inputs: symbol, timeframe (short|medium|long), and riskProfile (conservative|balanced|aggressive).
- Output: structured markdown analysis with sections (Executive Summary, Fundamental Analysis, Technical Analysis, Industry Context, Risk, Action Plan, Monitoring Checklist, Confidence).
- Safety: the pipeline never fabricates missing values — it explicitly calls out unavailable data and includes a caution that the output is informational, not investment advice.

Example request (curl):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/stock-analysis \
	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-d '{"symbol":"TCS", "timeframe":"medium", "riskProfile":"balanced"}'
```

Response (trimmed): JSON containing `symbol`, `timeframe`, `riskProfile`, `stockData` (snapshot) and `analysis` (markdown string).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (or latest LTS)
- npm (or yarn/pnpm)
- A running MongoDB instance (Atlas or local)
- SMTP credentials (for sending email)

### Installation

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd stock_market
npm install
# or: pnpm install
```

### Environment

Create a `.env` from the template and fill in values:

```env
# MongoDB connection string
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@cluster.example.mongodb.net/stock_market

# Better Auth configuration
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=replace_me_with_a_strong_random_secret
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Gemini / AI key used by Inngest AI integrations
GEMINI_API_KEY=replace_with_gemini_api_key

# Nodemailer SMTP
NODEMAILER_EMAIL=you@example.com
NODEMAILER_PASSWORD=supersecretpassword

# Optional: NODE_ENV (development|production)
NODE_ENV=development
```

Save the file as `.env` at project root.

### Run (dev)

```bash
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

### Build & Start (production)

## Architecture / Project Structure

Top-level layout (trimmed):

- `app/` — Next.js App Router pages and layouts
- `components/` — UI components and widgets (TradingView, TickerTape, Watchlist UI)
- `lib/` — client libraries, API wrappers, actions, Inngest functions, and nodemailer templates
- `database/` — MongoDB connection (`mongoose.ts`) and models (`models/*.ts`)
- `hooks/` — React hooks (`useDebounce`, TradingView hook)
- `api/` — server API routes used by client pages (`/api/news`, `/api/stock-analysis`, `/api/inngest`)

Example important files:

- [database/mongoose.ts](database/mongoose.ts) — MongoDB connection helper
- [lib/better-auth/auth.ts](lib/better-auth/auth.ts) — authentication setup
- [lib/inngest/client.ts](lib/inngest/client.ts) — background job client
- [components/WatchlistTable.tsx](components/WatchlistTable.tsx) — watchlist UI

---

## Future Roadmap

1. Add OAuth providers (Google/GitHub) via `better-auth` for faster onboarding.
2. Real-time WebSocket feed for live quotes and push notifications.
3. Advanced analytics: portfolio P&L, historical charts, and export CSVs.
4. CI/CD + Vercel deployment template with preview environments and test coverage reporting.
